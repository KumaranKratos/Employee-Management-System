# Employee Management System

This Employee Management System is a web application that allows administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. Built with React and WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP), this system ensures proper validation and authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive employee data.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new employee records with necessary details.
- **Read:** View existing employee details.
- **Update:** Edit and update employee information.
- **Delete:** Remove employee records.
- **Authentication:** Secure login for administrators to access and manage employee data.
- **Validation:** Ensures data integrity and proper input validation.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- **Styling:** CSS
- **Database:** MySQL

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-management-system.git
   cd employee-management-system
   ```

   - Install the dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the React application:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Access
